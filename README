			SuSE Security Checker

		(c) 1999,2000 by Marc Heuse <marc@suse.de>


The SuSE Security Checker is a set of several shellscripts which check the
local security of the system on a regular basis.

Three main scripts are executed:
	security-daily		is started daily by cron
	security-weekly		is started once a week by cron
	security-monthly	is started once a month by cron

Most code of the daily security script was ripped off the OpenBSD
/etc/security script.

The daily script runs at midnight, and only if changes to the last run (the
night before) are found, a mail with the differences will be sent.
The weekly script runs every monday at 1:00am, and only if changes to the
last run (the week before) are found, a mail with the differences will be
sent.
The monthly script runs every on every 1st of the month and sends the full
last daily and weekly report via email.

Please note that you can change the receiver of the seccheck mails from root
to anyone else if you add an entry like this one to /etc/sysconfig/seccheck:
SECCHK_USER="firewall" # exchange firewall is an admin user's account name

Please also note that the START_SECCHK variable from /etc/sysconfig/seccheck
controls whether the security check will be run from cron. (It's ignored, if
you call security-control manually.)

The following daily checks are done:
 /etc/passwd check : length/number/contents of fields, accounts with same uid
			accounts with uid/gid of 0 or 1 beside root and bin
 /etc/shadow check : length/number/contents of fields, accounts with no password
 /etc/group check  : length/number/contents of fields
 user root checks  : secure umask and PATH
 /etc/ftpusers     : checks if important system users are put there
 /etc/aliases      : checks for mail aliases which execute programs
 .rhosts check     : checks if users' .rhosts file contain + signs
 homedirectory     : checks if homedirectories are writable or owned by
			someone else
 dot-files check   : checks many dot-files in the homedirectories if they
			are writable or owned by someone else
 mailbox check     : checks if user mailboxes are owned by user and unreadable
 NFS export check  : exports should not be exported globaly
 NFS import check  : NFS mounts should have the "nosuid" option set
 promisc check     : checks if network cards are in promiscious mode
 list modules      : just lists loaded modules
 list sockets      : just lists open ports

The following weekly checks are done:
 password check    : runs john to crack the password file, user will get an
			email notice to change his password asap
 rpm md5 check     : checks for changed files via rpm's md5 checksum feature
 suid/sgid check   : lists all suid and sgid files
 exec group write  : lists all executables which are group/world writeable
 writable check    : lists all files which are world writable (incl. above)
 device check      : lists all devices

The following monthly things are done:
 The monthly file is not a diff like the daily/weekly ones but the full
 reports in one file.
